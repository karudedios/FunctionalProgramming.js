#Functional Programming JS

The concept of this project was based off of [RacoWireless/Functional Programming for C#](https://github.com/RacoWireless/FunctionalProgramming)

##Description
The objective of this project is to have access to some Functional Programming's concepts in order to ease some of the regular problems one can be presented with when developing something on Javascript.

For documentation, please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/karudedios/FunctionalProgramming.js/wiki)
